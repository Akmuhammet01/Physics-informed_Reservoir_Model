# Physics-informed_Reservoir_Model
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for 2D oil reservoir pressure modeling. This project implements a PINN to predict pressure dynamics using the diffusivity equation for single-well and multi-well scenarios. Includes code, visualizations, and results for reservoir simulation.
